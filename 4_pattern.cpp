/*

While solving patterns qns, first find the logic behind the pattern 
before jumping straight to code

Dry run the output first, from there you'll get the logic 

Note: Whenever an Alphabetical Pattern comes, first write it in the form of numbers, 
and then start dry running it

From there, you'll get the logic, and can easily convert the logic into char 
to get the desired alphabetical pattern
